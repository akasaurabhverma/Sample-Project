Usually organisms are classified on the basis of the kingdom they belong to...

There are only two kingdoms- 1.Plant Kingdom,   2.Animal Kingdom

But there are several organisms that does not fit to these categorisations
Thus more levels of classifications were created

Those levels are-

Kingdom
Phylum
Class 
Order
Family 
Genus 
Species


These are the seven levels of classification
